# Tech Lancaster
_The Official Tech Lancaster Website... Now with 20% more Tech Lancaster!_

## Objective
The goal of this site is to be the one stop shop for the tech community in the Lancaster area. The old TL site was just a home for the TL meetup. The new site can be an umbrella for all of them. This isn't a corporate take-over of all the meetups, though. We just think the community could benefit from a central location to dive off from. 

The central aspect of the new site will be a mirror of the existing community calendar to get an overview of the upcoming meet-ups and events. There will be some small amount of detail for each item, but we'll link out to the actual homes set up by that meetup's maintainer. We'll pull the data from the Google calendar so maintainers only have to update their info in one place.

We'll also try to create a compendium of resources for all of us. Want to start up a new meetup? We'll have info for that. New to the area and looking to plug in? We've got you covered. And if you have any other ideas for the site, let us know. We're building this together.

## Details
Our initial thoughts are as follows:

- A light PHP framework called [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/)
- [Bootstrap Sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) on the front
- Scraping the [community calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=6l7e832ee9bemt1i9c42vltrug%40group.calendar.google.com)
- Mocks and assets are in the /assets directory, using the following fonts:
    - Lato Regular
    - Lato Light
    - Lato Light Italic
    - Oswald Regular

As you can see, this repo is pretty bare. These are not set in stone. Yet...
