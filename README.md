# Tech Lancaster
The Official Tech Lancaster Website... Now with 20% more Tech Lancaster!

## Objective
The goal of this site is to be the one stop shop for all tech happenings in the Lancaster area. The old TL site was just a home for the TL meetup. The new site will be an umbrella for all of them. This isn't a corporate take-over of all the meetups. We just think the community could benefit from a central location to dive off from. 

The central aspect of the new site will be a community calendar to get an overview of the upcoming meet-ups and events. There will be some small amount of detail for each item, but we'll link out to the actual homes set up by that meetup's maintainer. We'll try to pull the data from the Google calendar so maintainers only have to update their info in one place.

## Contribute
Mi casa es su casa. Everyone is welcome to submit issues and/or pull requests. Come out to [hacknight](http://www.hacklancaster.net/) on Wednesday, August 26th, to help get the ball rolling!

## Details
Our initial thoughts are as follows:

- A light PHP framework called [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/)
- [Bootstrap Sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) on the front
- Scraping the [community calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=6l7e832ee9bemt1i9c42vltrug%40group.calendar.google.com)

As you can see, this repo is pretty bare. These are not set in stone. Yet...
